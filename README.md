# Advent of Code 2023

My [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions in Python.

Each day's solutions are found in the ``solutions/`` directory, in a subdirectory named for the day it belongs to, using the structure defined by my Advent of Code runner/helper, https://github.com/oogles/task-jogger-aoc.

To run a solution for a given day, e.g. day 1, use:

    jog aoc 1
